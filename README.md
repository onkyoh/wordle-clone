On Friday, the 8th of July, 2022, Rogers (a popular internet provider in Canada) went down. This lead to widespread loss of internet of many Canadians, me included. Due to this I took it upon myself to conduct a small challenge, which was to clone a web app offline. The reason I chose wordle is because I had recently seen a React.js interview on youtube where a developer was tasked with making wordle. After watching this video for a few mins I thought to myself, "hey, I could do that", and so I did. Roughly 24 hours after it begun I had finished the challenge, which explains this README. Suprisingly this, relatively small project taught me some things about React.js which I had not known like how nested map functions can each have their own index. All in all, fun project and challenge, which I would definently recommend to any developer who prefers web app over website.
